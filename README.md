# liveliness detection 
Face Liveness Detection is a technology in face recognition which checks whether the image from the webcam comes from a live person or not. Face Liveness Detection is an essential prerequiste of Face Recognition system. 
In face recognition, the identification of an individual is done by comparing the captured images with the stored images of that person in real time. These recognition systems are in the rapid development phase and are accumulated with a new strong algorithm that improves the system day by day. However, these systems are facing many security issues as frauds are increasing on a daily basis and there is a need to upgrade these systems to make them more secure, reliable and automatic. So by observing all these things we are inspired to build our project “Face Antispoofing System” which not only improves the existing system but also adapts to some of the security challenges making this system more secure and reliable.
In this video tutorial, we perform the end to end pipeline for deploying the face antispoofing system by using opencv. First, we train the liveness detection model by using our own dataset and then we deploy the trained model using opencv and python.

The liveliness project is a machine learning-based liveness detection system designed to distinguish between real, live images and spoofed or static images. This technology is essential for enhancing security in facial recognition systems, mobile devices, and authentication platforms, where it's critical to prevent unauthorized access via photos or videos of legitimate users.
By analyzing specific traits and features, the system can detect whether an image is captured from a live subject or is a fake representation. It has applications in identity verification, access control, and fraud prevention.

Features:
Detects spoofed images to prevent unauthorized access.
Capable of analyzing still images and recognizing live interactions.
Easy to integrate with existing authentication systems.
Tech Stack:
OpenCV: Likely used for image preprocessing tasks such as face detection, image scaling, and augmentation.
TensorFlow/Keras: The core machine learning frameworks used for building and training the model. These libraries allow for constructing deep learning architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), used to detect image spoofing.
Pandas & Numpy: For data manipulation, handling datasets, and efficient numeric operations.
